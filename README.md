### **Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

#### **Artifact: CS-340 Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Dashboard**

**Current Limitations:**

1. **Linear Search Operations:** All filtering and searching operations iterate through the entire dataset sequentially, resulting in O(n) time complexity
2. **No Data Structure Optimization:** Uses basic Python lists and dictionaries without leveraging advanced data structures
3. **Inefficient Sorting:** Uses Python's built-in sort without implementing custom algorithms optimized for specific use cases
4. **No Caching Mechanism:** Repeated queries fetch from database each time with no intelligent caching

**Why This Artifact:**

- **Real-World Dataset:** 10,000+ animal records make performance improvements measurable and meaningful
- **Multiple Search Criteria:** Searching by ID, breed, age, rescue type, and location provides opportunities to implement different optimized data structures

- **Improvement:** ~35x faster breed queries

**3. Merge Sort for Multi-Field Sorting**
- **Purpose:** Efficient O(n log n) sorting with guaranteed performance and stability
- **Use Case:** Fast sorting of 10,000+ records by any column
- **Improvement:** 30% faster + stability for tie-breaking

**4. QuickSelect for Finding Top N Animals**
- **Purpose:** Find top N animals without full sort - O(n) average vs. O(n log n)
- **Use Case:** "Show me the 10 youngest dogs suitable for water rescue"
- **Improvement:** ~5x faster for top-N queries

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Algorithm Implementation:** BST recursive/iterative operations, hash function design with collision handling, divide-and-conquer (merge sort), partitioning algorithms (quickselect)

### **Category Three: Databases**

#### **Artifact: CS-360 Weight Tracker Android Application**

**Origin:** CS 360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming, August 2024

**Current State:**
- Android app using SQLite local database
- Three tables: Users, WeightEntries, Goals
- All data stored on device only

**Why Enhance:**

Migrate to MongoDB to demonstrate NoSQL database design and modern database practices.

**Planned Enhancements:**

**Migration: SQLite → MongoDB**

**Core Changes:**
1. Replace SQLite tables with MongoDB collections
2. Redesign schema using NoSQL best practices (embedded documents vs. references)
3. Create indexes for query optimization
4. Implement aggregation pipelines for analytics
5. Add REST API (simple Express.js) to connect Android app to MongoDB

**Schema Transformation:**

**Before (SQLite - Relational):**
```
Users: id, username, password
WeightEntries: id, user_id, weight, date
Goals: id, user_id, target_weight, target_date
```

**After (MongoDB - Document-Based):**
```javascript
// users collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: String (indexed),
  email: String,
  passwordHash: String,
  profile: {
    targetWeight: Number,
    height: Number,
    unit: "lbs"
  }
}

// weightEntries collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (indexed),
  weight: Number,
  date: Date (indexed),
  note: String
}

// goals collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId (indexed),
  targetWeight: Number,
  startWeight: Number,
  targetDate: Date,
  status: "active" | "achieved",
  progressHistory: [{
    date: Date,
    weight: Number
  }]
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Embedded documents (profile inside user)
- Proper Date objects instead of TEXT strings
- Arrays for progress history (MongoDB native)
- ObjectId for relationships instead of integers

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **NoSQL Database Design:** Document-based schema vs. relational tables, embedded documents (denormalization), reference patterns (one-to-many), data type optimization
- **MongoDB Expertise:** CRUD operations with MongoDB Java Driver, aggregation pipeline syntax, index creation and optimization, query performance analysis
- **Database Migration:** ETL process, data type conversion, foreign key → ObjectId reference mapping, data validation post-migration
- **Performance Optimization:** Single-field indexes for unique constraints, compound indexes for multi-field queries, index selection strategy

**Course Outcomes Alignment:**

**Outcome 4: Well-Founded Techniques**
- MongoDB is industry-standard NoSQL database
- Demonstrates modern document-based design
- Aggregation pipelines are MongoDB best practice
- Local MongoDB useful for development/testing environments

**Outcome 5: Security**
- Password hashing (bcrypt) instead of plain text
- Input validation for database operations
- NoSQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)

**Outcome 2: Professional Communication**
- Schema diagrams comparing SQL vs NoSQL
- Migration documentation

## 💼 ePortfolio Overall Skill Set

### **Skills and outcomes illustrated in the code review**

The code review video will demonstrate my ability to analyze existing code and communicate technical concepts to both peers and managers. I will walk through two artifacts—the CS 340 Grazioso Salvare Dashboard and the CS 360 Weight Tracker application—identifying their current functionality, strengths, and weaknesses. For the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard, I will explain how the Python/Dash implementation currently uses basic linear search operations with O(n) complexity and lacks optimized data structures, making it slow with large datasets. I will articulate why converting this to a MERN stack application with Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, and efficient sorting algorithms will improve performance by 5-30x. For the Weight Tracker app, I will demonstrate the limitations of the current SQLite local-only database and explain how migrating to MongoDB will enable better schema design with embedded documents, aggregation pipelines for analytics, and proper indexing strategies. Throughout the review, I will outline my enhancement plans for all three categories—Software Design and Engineering (MERN conversion with RESTful API and security improvements), Algorithms and Data Structures (implementing BST, hash tables, merge sort, and quickselect with Big O analysis), and Databases (SQLite to MongoDB migration with NoSQL schema design). This video will showcase my professional oral communication skills, my ability to evaluate code quality and performance bottlenecks, and my understanding of modern software engineering practices, aligning with Course Outcomes 2 (professional communication), 3 (algorithmic analysis), and 4 (well-founded techniques).

### **Skills and outcomes illustrated in the narratives**

The enhancement narratives will demonstrate my technical writing abilities and my capacity to justify design decisions with explanations of the enhancement process, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. For the Software Design and Engineering narrative, I will explain my architectural transformation from a Python/Dash monolithic application to a MERN stack with clear separation between client (React), server (Express.js), and database (MongoDB) tiers. I will document the implementation of JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), input validation middleware, and security best practices following OWASP guidelines. The narrative will include before-and-after code comparisons, architectural diagrams showing the three-tier structure, and explanations of why I chose specific design patterns like MVC. For the Algorithms and Data Structures narrative, I will provide detailed explanations of each algorithm's implementation, including pseudocode, complexity analysis (time and space), and performance benchmarking results. I will justify why I selected BST for ID lookups (O(log n) vs O(n) linear search), Hash Tables for breed filtering (O(1) average case), Merge Sort for stable multi-field sorting (guaranteed O(n log n)), and QuickSelect for top-N queries (O(n) average vs O(n log n) full sort). Each algorithm will include trade-off analysis comparing alternatives I considered but rejected. For the Databases narrative, I will document the SQLite to MongoDB migration process, explaining the transformation from relational tables with foreign keys to document-based collections with ObjectId references and embedded subdocuments. I will justify design decisions like when to embed documents versus reference them, explain my indexing strategy with compound indexes for common query patterns, and demonstrate aggregation pipelines for calculating weekly weight averages and goal progress percentages. These narratives will showcase my technical documentation skills, critical thinking in design decisions, and ability to communicate complex technical concepts in writing, aligning with Course Outcomes 2 (professional written communication), 3 (algorithmic problem-solving), 4 (innovative techniques), and 5 (security mindset).

### **Skills and outcomes illustrated in the professional self-assessment**

The professional self-assessment will provide a reflection on my entire Computer Science journey at SNHU. I will address the five key areas explicitly: **collaboration** by explaining how the MERN stack and RESTful APIs I've implemented enable team-based development with clear separation between frontend and backend teams; **communication with stakeholders** by describing how I've learned to translate technical concepts like Big O complexity into business value like "10x faster searches" and "supports 100,000 animals instead of 10,000"; **data structures and algorithms** by reflecting on how I've moved from basic array manipulation to implementing structures like Binary Search Trees and understanding when to apply specific algorithms based on use case and performance requirements; **software engineering and databases** by discussing my evolution from simple CRUD applications to architecting systems with proper authentication, input validation, and NoSQL schema design; and **security** by explaining how I've developed a security-first mindset through implementing password hashing with bcrypt, JWT authentication with token expiration, RBAC for authorization, and input sanitization to prevent injection attacks. I will articulate my career goals to become a full-stack software engineer and explain how this ePortfolio positions me for roles at companies. I will also reflect on specific challenges I overcame during the enhancements.
